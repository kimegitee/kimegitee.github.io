<h1 id="principles-for-sane-programming">Principles for sane programming</h1>
<p>As usual, anything written here tell you more about what I don’t know more than what I know.</p>
<p>This is an evolving blog post. I will update this list with new principles as they arise.</p>
<h3 id="always-start-with-a-clean-slate">1. Always start with a clean slate</h3>
<p>A clean slate frees you from worries about hidden state. It forces you to make decisions about things that has been nagging at you but guiltily ignored. Ignore files you don’t need, they eat up your mental resources each time you run git status. Make decisions about where files should be and commit them. Then you can start anew paying attention to only the things you care about at the moment.</p>
<h3 id="always-finish-with-a-clean-slate">2. Always finish with a clean slate</h3>
<p>In the same vein with (1), leaving things laying about makes it hard to return to later, be it a few weeks or even months down the line. Do the uncomfortable task of making decisions then committing everything and you will not have to ask yourself “where was I” next time you pick it up.</p>
<h3 id="update-2212022">Update 22/1/2022</h3>
<p>As with any act of commentary, it seems always obvious to ask the meta question. What does the above two principles tell you about the profession of programming? It seems to value neatness. And indeed, if we were to look around, then the computer is the epitome of neatness. Lines are aligned perfectly to the pixels. Each button, each key press does exactly what they are programmed to do when pressed. So much that, if you are not originally a neat person, you will find it beneficial to become one.</p>
<p>So again, any general virtue is also beneficial applied to a specific profession?</p>
<p>It’s funny no company ever ask for virtue in their application. They ask for values, but what makes a person a worthwhile collaborator are exactly the things that have made anyone a worthwhile collaborator in the entire history of the world. Humble brags are laughably unvirtuous. Since when on earth is it good to talk about your achievements?</p>
