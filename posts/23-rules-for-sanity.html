<p>(Draft)</p>
<p>Turn off all notifications. This is not at all my idea, but if it has not been extolled to you, or has never occured to you, then it is worth a moment to consider why it is a good thing. Revisit that feeling for a moment, when your phone buzzes and there it is something new has come up and demand your attention immediately right there and then. If it happens on a computer, can you not stop for moment to dart a glance at that little pop up thingy that is so urgent that should take the first priority?</p>
<p>And what do I mean by “all” notifications? Most applications today are insulting to people’s time and attention. There are forces at play that continue to nudge you into the direction of giving away more and more of you sanity in the service of who knows what. If a large part of a person’s function is processing information, then by receiving continuous input all day every day for hours on end, you are simply frying all your circuitry for the most valuable thing that you do - thinking.</p>
<p>Notice the vicious trickery they employ every day to steal a bit more of your sanity. There’s a little text box that said “more unread” on the left side of Slack when you have a long list of channels. When you scroll up, it said “more unread below”, and if you are hapless enough to follow its lead and scroll down, then it screams again “more unread above”. As if it cannot let you be for just a moment. More tweets below, more videos, scroll to recent… “More, more, more”! And you wonder why you never have enough?</p>
