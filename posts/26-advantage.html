<h2 id="unfair-advantage">Unfair advantage</h2>
<p>There was once a video of an unassuming girl beating a guy who was provoking her to pulp trending on a social media site. A prominent author commented: “Unfair advantage.” I read the “advantage” he was referring to as “being underestimated”. That is a comforting thought to moments when you feel like you are being treated unfairly, that your strengths and values are unacknowledged. In attention courting, in trying to impress people, or any of forms of pleasing the crowd… it is a bad situation to be in. Yet in adversarial situations, in battles, in competitions, isn’t it always better to be underestimated? To know things people scarcely realize is valuable? To see things that nobody pay attention to? You should rejoice in obscurity, take great delight in being misunderstood. For you win when you have an advantage, and lose when you don’t. It’s that simple.</p>
