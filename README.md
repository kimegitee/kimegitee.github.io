# Lesson learned from 7 months of waiting to start blogging

Static pages generators are great, but if you are still putting it off, then a simple git repo should do as well.

Practicing my newly invented adage, it's more important to be lucky than to work hard. A blog allows you to be lucky, whereas grinding away in silence allows you to be ready.

Some objections you may have

1. What if my ideas are not refined? I need to draft before making stuff public.

   We can pretend posts are pseudo-hidden as long as it is not linked to this README. Draft all you want then when's it's ready put a link to this front page.

So the list only have one item. Who cares? It can be fixed later. Just like normal software.

Does it also not need a powerful punchline?

Does it not also have to keep the audience in mind? To be mindful not to waste their time? To provide "value" in exchange for future interest? Can always be fixed later.

So it'll be.
